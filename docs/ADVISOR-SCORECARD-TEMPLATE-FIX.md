# Advisor Scorecard Template Loading Fix

## üêõ Issue Identified

**Problem**: Advisor-level scorecards (PersonalScorecard.tsx) were not showing all services and KPIs from the Tire South template, while admin-level scorecards (AdvisorScorecards.tsx) were working correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `marketId` was hardcoded to `'TBD'` in PersonalScorecard.tsx, preventing the AdvisorScorecard component from loading the correct market-specific template.

## üîç Investigation Findings

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Admin View (AdvisorScorecards.tsx)**: ‚úÖ Working correctly
   - Gets user data with `market_assignments` and `store_assignments`
   - Correctly extracts `marketId` from assignments: `user.market_assignments?.[0]?.market_id`
   - AdvisorScorecard component loads template: `/api/scorecard-templates/market/${advisor.marketId}`

2. **Advisor View (PersonalScorecard.tsx)**: ‚ùå Issue found
   - User object from AuthContext doesn't include market/store assignments
   - `marketId` was hardcoded to `'TBD'` 
   - Template loading failed: `Cannot find template for market 'TBD'`

### Template Loading Dependency Chain
```
PersonalScorecard ‚Üí AdvisorScorecard ‚Üí Template Loading
       ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                ‚Üì
  marketId='TBD'    No template found    Fallback KPIs only
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced by-store API Endpoint
**File**: `api/routes/scorecard.js` - `/api/scorecard/advisor/:userId/by-store`

**Changes**:
- Added `s.market_id, m.name as market_name` to SQL queries
- Enhanced store data structure to include market information
- Added market info to response: `marketId`, `marketName`

```javascript
// Enhanced query with market data
SELECT 
  pd.upload_date, pd.data, pd.store_id,
  s.name as store_name, s.id as store_id_numeric,
  s.market_id, m.name as market_name  // ‚Üê Added market info
FROM performance_data pd
LEFT JOIN stores s ON pd.store_id::text = s.id::text
LEFT JOIN markets m ON s.market_id = m.id  // ‚Üê Added market join
```

### 2. Updated PersonalScorecard Logic
**File**: `frontend/src/components/Scorecard/PersonalScorecard.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Use market ID from by-store API response: `multiStoreData.marketId`
- Fallback to Tire South market (694) if by-store API fails
- Proper market ID propagation to AdvisorScorecard component

```typescript
// Fixed market ID assignment
marketId: multiStoreData.marketId || 'TBD',  // ‚Üê From API response
marketName: multiStoreData.marketName || 'TBD',

// Fallback case
marketId: 694, // ‚Üê Default to Tire South for template loading
```

### 3. Enhanced StorePerformanceTabs Component
**File**: `frontend/src/components/Scorecard/StorePerformanceTabs.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated interfaces to include market information
- Pass market ID through to individual store scorecards
- Proper template loading for all tab variations

## üéØ Result

### Before Fix
```
Advisor Personal View:
- marketId: 'TBD'
- Template: Default fallback (limited KPIs)
- Services: Basic services only
```

### After Fix
```
Advisor Personal View:
- marketId: 694 (or actual market from data)
- Template: Tire South market template
- Services: All configured services and KPIs
- Tabs: Full multi-store support with proper templates
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Data Flow (Fixed)
1. **PersonalScorecard** calls `/api/scorecard/advisor/:userId/by-store`
2. **API** returns market info from store ‚Üí market relationship
3. **AdvisorScorecard** loads template: `/api/scorecard-templates/market/694`
4. **Template** renders all configured services and KPIs

### Key Dependencies
- **Markets Table**: Contains market definitions
- **Stores Table**: Links stores to markets (`market_id` FK)
- **Performance Data**: Links advisors to stores (`store_id`)
- **Scorecard Templates**: Market-specific field configurations
- **Service Catalog**: Master list of available KPIs/services

## üéØ Impact

### For Single-Store Advisors
- ‚úÖ Now see complete Tire South template with all services
- ‚úÖ Proper KPI categories and field organization
- ‚úÖ Vendor-mapped branded service names
- ‚úÖ Goal indicators and achievement tracking

### For Multi-Store Advisors  
- ‚úÖ Rollup tab shows combined performance with full template
- ‚úÖ Individual store tabs show store-specific data with templates
- ‚úÖ Compare tab works with complete service lists
- ‚úÖ All tabs respect market-specific template configuration

### Backward Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Admin view unchanged and continues working
- ‚úÖ Single-store advisors see no UI changes
- ‚úÖ All existing API endpoints preserved
- ‚úÖ No database schema changes required

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Advisor login shows complete service list (not just basic KPIs)
- [ ] Multi-store advisor tabs all show full templates
- [ ] Vendor-mapped service names display correctly
- [ ] Goal indicators work in all views
- [ ] Service categories render properly
- [ ] MTD month selection affects all data

## üìä Root Cause Summary

The issue was a **data access problem**, not a template or service mapping issue:

1. **Admin view**: Had access to user assignments ‚Üí correct market ID ‚Üí proper template
2. **Advisor view**: No access to assignments ‚Üí hardcoded 'TBD' ‚Üí fallback template
3. **Fix**: Enhanced API to provide market info ‚Üí proper template loading ‚Üí complete service display

This fix ensures both admin and advisor views use the same template loading mechanism and display identical service information.
