## 🔧 Service Mapping & Vendor Integration Fixes (2025-07-30)

### Issues Resolved

  - Resolved database column name mismatches (`firstName`/`lastName` vs `first_name`/`last_name`)
  - Fixed type casting issues between `user_store_assignments` and `users` tables
  - Removed corrupted data entries with non-numeric user IDs

- **Service Management:** Fixed "failed to load services" error
  - Corrected route ordering issue where `/:id` route was intercepting `/available-for-calculation`
  - Moved specific routes before parameterized routes in Express router

- **Vendor Tags Cleanup:** Removed dummy vendor data
  - Kept only real vendor tag: "bg_products"
  - Cleaned up test/development entries

### 🆕 New Features
- **GitHub Integration:** Added project to GitHub repository
  - Created comprehensive `.gitignore` for Node.js/Docker projects
  - Initialized git repository and pushed to GitHub

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Store Management:** Auto-display store managers from user assignments
  - Modified stores API to join with `user_store_assignments`
  - Added `STRING_AGG` to concatenate multiple store managers

### 🔄 API Improvements
- **Vendor Mappings API Restructure:**
  - Fixed unreachable code issue in `/api/vendor-mappings` endpoint
  - Now properly returns `{ mappings: [...] }` format for scorecard compatibility
  - Supports filtering by `vendor_id` and `market_id` parameters

### 🎯 Advisor Scorecard Enhancement (In Progress)
- **Service Mapping Integration:** Working on dynamic branded service names
  - Added debugging capability to track service mapping data flow
  - Frontend prepared to display vendor-branded names (e.g., "BG Advanced Formula MOA®" instead of "Premium Oil Change")
  - Debug console logging added for troubleshooting

### 📊 Database Changes
- **Cleaned Data Integrity:**
  - Removed corrupted user assignment records with string IDs
  - Verified vendor product mappings table structure
  - Current mappings: `premiumOilChange` → "BG Advanced Formula MOA®"

### 🔍 Debug Tools Added
- **Frontend Debugging:** Added console logging to trace service mapping data flow
- **API Response Tracking:** Debug output for vendor-mappings endpoint responses
- **Service Display Name Tracking:** Logging to verify branded name substitution

### Next Steps
- Complete advisor scorecard branded service name display
- Remove debug logging once functionality is verified
- Test full end-to-end service mapping workflow
